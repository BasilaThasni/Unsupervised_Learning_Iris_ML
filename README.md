# Iris Dataset Clustering Analysis

This repository provides a detailed analysis of the famous Iris dataset, focusing on clustering techniques such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. The goal is to explore the natural grouping of different Iris species and assess the effectiveness of each clustering method.

## Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:
- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

These samples are classified into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset is widely used in data science as a classic example of classification and clustering.

## Usage

### 1. Data Exploration
Explore the Iris dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand feature distributions and relationships.

### 2. Clustering Analysis
Apply clustering algorithms to group iris flowers:
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**

### 3. Evaluation
Assess clustering performance using the **silhouette score**.
